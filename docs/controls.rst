Controls
========

There are 3 ways to control VMPC2000XL:

* Keyboard
* Mouse
* MIDI

It is **strongly recommended** to get familiar with :ref:`basic keyboard shortcuts <basic_operations>` rather than relying on the mouse. The more keyboard shortcuts you use, likely the greater the sense of immersion.

The other buttons are also mapped to keyboard shortcuts, but you can pick these up as you go.

.. note::

  The degree of MIDI controllability is the same as on the real MPC2000XL, i.e. not every button can be mapped to a MIDI control change parameter, and there's a limit to 4 mappings at a given moment.

Keyboard
--------

Below are the default keyboard shortcuts for most of the UI components.

Some letter keys are written in uppercase for disambiguation. For example, :code:`Record` is mapped to the letter :kbd:`L` and is written in uppercase to clarify it is not letter :kbd:`i` or number :kbd:`1`, so there is no need to press :kbd:`Shift` here.

In the same vein some special characters are clarified by appending their name in parentheses, for example :kbd:`; (semicolon)`.

.. note::

  The keyboard shortcuts are configurable. See :ref:`Configuring the Keyboard <configuring_the_keyboard>` for instructions.
